rs-backup: a simple tool to backup remote servers to ZFS storage with snapshots

Setup:

1. clone the repository
2. create backup job configuration files in /jobs. See example in that
   directory. Filenames must end with .conf to be executed.
3. create /var/log/rs-backup/jobs
4. run rs-backup.sh

On remote machines you need to run rsyncd and allow access from the backup
machine ONLY!
Exclusions are configured on machines themselves.

We welcome questions, ideas, pull requests >:'> etc.

In the future i'd like this to be a backupninja module, but did not have time
to figure it out, therefore this little hack.
